profile1	mvn install -Pprof1
profile2	mvn install -Dpr=2
profile3	mvn install -> executes automatically if JDK1.7 (or change <activation><jdk> to your ver of JDK)
profile4	mvn install -> executes as default if no other profile specified or matched
profile5	mvn install -> executes automatically if runs on defined Windows version

You can always execute a profile by its ID
	mvn install -Pprof5

How can I tell which profiles are in effect during a build?
mvn help:active-profiles	 - prof4 (source: com.acds:zebApp:1.0.0)
mvn help:active-profiles -Dpr=2	 - prof2 (source: com.acds:zebApp:1.0.0)
